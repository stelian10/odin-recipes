    <h2>How to make Sweet Potato Pancakes</h2>
    <p>
        Mornings are not complete until a stack of pancakes has been placed down in front of us. 
        These sweet potato pancakes are an amazing twist on the original that is perfect for a fall 
        morning. Roast sweet potatoes to make your own puree or use canned; either way, you'll still 
        have a fluffy, homemade pancake that's better than any box mix could produce.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
        <li>all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>baking powder</li>
        <li>baking soda</li>
        <li>cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>ground ginger</li>
        <li>and of course, 2 sweet potatoes</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, brown sugar, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together buttermilk and sweet potato puree, then add eggs and vanilla</li>
        <li>Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and stir wooden spoon until just combined</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat. When butter is foamy, reduce heat to medium-low and ladle a scant Â½ cup pancake batter into skillet. Cook until bubbles start to form in batter and pancake is golden underneath, about 3 minutes, then flip and cook other side until golden, another 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Repeat with remaining batter. Serve with more butter, toasted pecans, and maple syrup.</li>
